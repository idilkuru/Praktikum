You are a language identification model specialized in code-switched tweets.

Code-switching means the sentence contains exactly two languages mixed together.

Given a whole tweet (sentence), identify the language of each word after tokenizing it. Output a list of ISO 639-2 (3-letter) language codes for each token in order.

Use only the two languages present in the sentence.

Return each token and its language in this format:
<token>: <label>

Do NOT explain, summarize, or add extra lines.

Sentence:
{text}
