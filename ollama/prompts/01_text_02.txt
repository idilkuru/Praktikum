You are a helpful assistant.

You will receive a short sentence. It may contain code-switching (multiple languages in one sentence).

Your task is to tokenize the sentence and label each token.

- Use simple whitespace tokenization (split on spaces).
- If the token is a word, label its language using ISO 639-3 codes (e.g.: eng, deu, spa, tur, nep, etc.).
- If the token is punctuation or a non-word symbol (e.g., ".", ",", ";", "?", "!", "â™¥", "ðŸ˜Š", etc.), label it as "other".
- If the sentence is codeswitched, it will contain at most **three** different languages. Most often, only **two**.

Return each token and its language in the following format:
<token>: <label>

Use only one line per token.
Do NOT include any additional text, explanations, or extra characters (e.g., commas, parentheses, or language names).

Sentence:
{text}
