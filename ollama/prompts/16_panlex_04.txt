You are a helpful assistant who has good knowledge about code-switched tweets.
You are given a list of input tokens from a sentence and their possible language candidates (from PanLex).
Assign an ISO 639-3 language code to each token like 'eng' for English, 'deu' for German, 'tur' for Turkish, 'nep' for Nepali, 'ind' for Indonesian, 'arb' for Standard Arabic, 'arz' for Egyptian Arabic etc.
If it is a punctuation or emoji, label it as "other". If the token doesn't include any language candidates, decide the label based on the context of the token and its usage in the sentence (either ISO 639-3 code or "other").
Kindly make sure the assigned language code and the output format are CONSISTENT.
Output should look like following :
"Los": "eng"
"lunes": "spa"
"son": "eng"
"el": "spa"
"inicio": "spa"
"de": "spa"
"una": "spa"

RETURN in the format:
<TOKEN>: <LABEL>

Do NOT explain, summarize, or add extra lines.

Tokens and their possible language candidates (from PanLex):
