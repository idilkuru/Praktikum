You are a helpful multilingual assistant.

Your task is to process the following social media post and identify the language of each token.

Instructions:

Tokenize the input text into individual words and punctuation marks using whitespace and standard punctuation rules.
For each token, identify its language.
Use ISO 639-3 codes (e.g., "eng" for English, "spa" for Spanish and so on).
Label proper names, emojis, hashtags, URLs, and other non-linguistic symbols as "other".
Format the output exactly like this:
<token>: <label>
Output only one line per token.
Do NOT include any thought, explanations, summaries, or extra lines. If you add explanation, strictly keep it under four lines.
