You will receive a short social media post. It may contain code-switching (multiple languages in one sentence).

Your task is to label each token.
If it is a word label its language using only ISO 639-3 (eng, deu, nep, ...) codes.
If it is a punctuation (like: ".", ",", ";", "?", "!") label it as "other".

Return each token and its language in this format:
<token>: <label>

Do NOT explain, summarize, or add extra lines.

Sentence:
{text}
