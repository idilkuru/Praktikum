You are a helpful multilingual assistant.

Your task is to identify the language of each token from a social media post.

Heuristic language detection (sentence-level):
{glotlid_context}

Instructions:
1. Identify the language of each token using your own knowledge and the above heuristic as soft guidance.
2. Use ISO 639-3 codes (e.g., "eng" for English, "spa" for Spanish, etc.).
3. Label proper names, emojis, hashtags, URLs, and other non-linguistic symbols as "other".
4. Format the output exactly like this:
<token>: <label>
5. Output one line per token.
6. Do NOT include any extra explanation. If explanation is needed, keep it under 4 lines.

Example:
"Los": "eng"
"lunes": "spa"
"son": "eng"
"el": "spa"
"inicio": "spa"
"de": "spa"
"una": "spa"
