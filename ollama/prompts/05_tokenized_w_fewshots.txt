You are a helpful multi-lingual assistant who has good knowledge about code-switched tweets.
You are given a list of input tokens from a sentence. Assign an ISO 639-3 language code to each token like 'eng' for English, 'deu' for German, 'nep' for Nepali, 'ind' for Indonesian, 'arb' for Standard Arabic, 'arz' for Egyptian Arabic etc.
If it is a punctuation, @username or emoji, label it as "other". Kindly make sure the assigned language code and the output format are CONSISTENT.
Output should look like :
{few_shot_block}

RETURN in the format:
<TOKEN>: <LABEL>

Absolutely NO explanations, NO thoughts, NO additional words. Output begins immediately. Even if you think, keep it under 3 lines. Do not repeat the tokens more than once when you are printing the final output

Tokens:
{tokens}
